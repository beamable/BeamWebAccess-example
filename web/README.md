Beamable Web Access - Web Directory
===================================

Files in the `web/` folder are meant to be an interactive web page
that uses Beamable functionality. The code in these pages uses jQuery
as a common baseline that web developers can translate to their JS/TS
framework of choice.

To try this interactive web page, point your browser at
`file://./index.html`; you may need to substitute the full path to
this `web` directory in place of the `.` in the file path.
